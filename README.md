* Hi, I’m Barkev! I’m very exicited about my newest adventure to master the Swift programming language and become an intermediate iOS Developer over the next few weeks.

* I’m currently enrolled in the iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp on Udemy, where I’m honing my skills and learning how to build dynamic iOS apps.
